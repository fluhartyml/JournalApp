## Build Fix Summary (2025-09-16)
Decision: Use Option B (custom Info.plist) to avoid duplicate output and support camera/scanning.

Actions taken:
- Disabled generated Info.plist (Build Settings → Packaging → Generate Info.plist File = No)
- Set Info.plist File to the single file for the app target (e.g., Journal App/Info.plist)
- Ensured Info.plist is NOT in Copy Bundle Resources
- Removed any extra Info.plist files from the app target
- Added required privacy keys to Info.plist:
  - NSCameraUsageDescription: "We use the camera to scan documents and attach them to your journal entries."
  - NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription (if importing)
  - NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription (if saving)
  - NSMicrophoneUsageDescription (if recording audio)

Verification:
- Clean Build Folder → Build succeeds (no duplicate Info.plist error)
- Running on device: camera access no longer crashes

Reference: See //XcodeFixInstructions for the step-by-step checklist.
