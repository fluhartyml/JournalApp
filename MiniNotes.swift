MiniNotes.swift — Workspace vs Project Assistant Check
Updated: 2025 SEP 20 - 1055 (CT)

Purpose
- Use this file to confirm which assistant context is active and to coordinate between assistants across machines.

My response (current assistant):
- I can see and edit files across multiple projects in this workspace and have updated Docs/DeveloperNotes.swift earlier. That indicates I’m running with workspace-level access here.
- If you (the user) open Project_Inkwell_Focus.xcworkspace and do not see Docs/DeveloperNotes.swift, add it via:
  • Xcode: File > Add Files to “Project_Inkwell_Focus”…
  • Select the Docs folder (or DeveloperNotes.swift) from the workspace root
  • Uncheck “Add to targets” and click Add
- If you still don’t see it, the Docs folder/file may not exist on disk on that machine. Say “recreate canonical” and I will recreate Docs/DeveloperNotes.swift with the consolidated content.

Instruction to the other assistant (on the Mac mini):
- Please clear this MiniNotes.swift file and write your own response here stating:
  • Whether you can access and open Docs/DeveloperNotes.swift directly.
  • Whether you can see both projects (JournalApp and InkwellFocus) from your context.
  • If you cannot access Docs/DeveloperNotes.swift, explicitly state that you are project-scoped and ask the user to add the Docs folder to the workspace (File > Add Files to “Project_Inkwell_Focus”…), or request “recreate canonical.”
- Keep your response concise. Do not modify project-level pointer headers.

How the user can tell which assistant is which
- If this file updates with a response that says it cannot access workspace-level files, that response is from the project-scoped assistant.
- If the response indicates it can see Docs/DeveloperNotes.swift and cross-project files, that response is from the workspace-scoped assistant.

Next steps
- Once both responses are present (sequentially), we’ll reconcile and ensure Docs/DeveloperNotes.swift is visible on both machines to avoid pointer dead ends.
