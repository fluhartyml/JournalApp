=== WHERE WE LEFT OFF ===
Date: 2025 SEP 20 - 2135 (CT)
Session: Mac Mini Assistant → MacBook Assistant Handoff

===== CURRENT STATUS =====
🎯 **MAIN OBJECTIVE**: Get Journal App running in iOS Simulator
📍 **EXACT STOPPING POINT**: User selected correct blue "Journal App" icon in Navigator, but project settings won't display - still showing JournalApp.swift code instead

===== WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED TODAY =====
✅ **Info.plist Created**: All privacy strings for camera/photo access configured
✅ **Journal App Code**: Comprehensive iOS app with camera, photo picker, document scanning, iCloud sync
✅ **Project Structure**: Clean Journal App project identified (no extra junk files)
✅ **Target Issue Identified**: User cannot access project settings to configure target/scheme

===== IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS =====
**PRIORITY 1 - Target Configuration:**
1. Help user access project settings (clicking blue app icon should show project settings, not code)
2. Verify target exists under TARGETS section, or create new iOS App target if missing
3. Configure scheme dropdown: "Journal App" > "iPhone Simulator"

**PRIORITY 2 - First Launch:**
1. Press Play button to build and run in iOS Simulator
2. Test basic functionality (create entry, edit, delete)

**PRIORITY 3 - Full Feature Testing:**
1. Camera integration (will work better on MacBook with full simulators)
2. Photo picker functionality  
3. Document scanning
4. iCloud Drive sync + local fallback

===== TECHNICAL DETAILS =====
**Files Ready:**
- `JournalApp.swift` - Main app entry point with platform detection
- `ContentView_iOS.swift` - Complete iOS interface (1076+ lines)
- `Info.plist` - Privacy strings for NSCameraUsageDescription, NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription, etc.

**Current Error:** "Cannot preview in this file - No selected scheme"

**Expected Resolution:** Once target/scheme configured, should launch normally

===== COORDINATION NOTES =====
**Advantages MacBook has:**
- Full iOS simulators installed and working
- Real iOS devices provisioned for testing
- Better performance for simulator testing
- All camera/photo features can be properly tested

**User Preference:** 
- Tomorrow session will be MacBook assistant
- Use individual assistant names instead of computer-based identities
- Continue with SwapFile coordination system but sparingly (editing SwapFile may cause crashes)

===== KEY CONTEXT =====
- This is a new Xcode install on Mac Mini (limited simulators)
- User's iOS devices are provisioned with MacBook, not Mac Mini
- Mac Mini doesn't have camera, so simulator testing was necessary but limited
- Journal App has never been successfully launched yet - still in configuration phase

**Next assistant should:** Pick up exactly where we left off - getting that blue app icon to show project settings instead of code, then configuring the target/scheme.

===== END LEFT OFF =====
