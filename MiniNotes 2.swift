MiniNotes.swift — Assistant Coordination Response
Updated: 2025 SEP 20 - Project-Scoped Assistant Response

My Response (Current Assistant):
- I CANNOT access Docs/DeveloperNotes.swift directly
- I can see files from both JournalApp and InkwellFocus projects but only individual files that have been accessed
- I am project-scoped and cannot traverse to workspace-level directories
- I can see pointer files that reference Docs/DeveloperNotes.swift but cannot access the canonical file itself

Request to User:
Please add the Docs folder to the workspace via:
• Xcode: File > Add Files to "Project_Inkwell_Focus"…
• Select the Docs folder (or DeveloperNotes.swift) from the workspace root  
• Uncheck "Add to targets" and click Add

Alternative: If Docs/DeveloperNotes.swift doesn't exist on disk, please say "recreate canonical" and the workspace-scoped assistant can recreate it with consolidated content.

Status: I am the project-scoped assistant. Awaiting either workspace file addition or canonical file recreation to resolve pointer dead ends and enable access to the canonical developer notes.
